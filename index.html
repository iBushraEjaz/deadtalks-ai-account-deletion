  <h1>DeadTalks AI – Account & Data Deletion</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>Email address (if used for sign-in)</li>
    <li>User ID (UID)</li>
    <li>Authentication tokens</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Open the app and go to the <strong>Profile</strong> section.</li>
    <li>You will see two options: <strong>Logout</strong> and <strong>Delete Account</strong>.</li>
    <li>Tap on <strong>Delete Account</strong>.</li>
    <li>The app will ask the user to type <strong>DELETE</strong> to confirm.</li>
    <li>After typing “DELETE” and pressing <strong>Delete Account</strong>, the user’s account is permanently removed.</li>
  </ol>
